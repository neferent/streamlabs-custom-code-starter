# Streamlabs Custom Code Starter

This is a collection of code for adding custom code to the Widgets at [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com).

The files are organized in a way that each file, or part thereof is easy to copy and paste into the Custom HTML/CSS/JS text boxes in each widget while also maintaining enough code integrity to render inside of a simple web server like [Phoenix Code](https://phcode.io/) (Made by the creators of Brackets)
